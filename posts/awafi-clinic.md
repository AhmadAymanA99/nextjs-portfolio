## Introduction:
Awafi Clinic is a Saudi platform for remote psychological care, specializing in mental health, psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), and family medicine. It operates using the Stepped Care model and therapeutic programs, under the supervision of Dr. Khalid Bin Hamad Al-Jaber, who has over 25 years of experience in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

### My Contribution:
As part of the Softera team, I contributed to the development and support of Awafi Clinic, delivering modules including:
• User authentication system
• Scheduling and booking workflows
• Arabic-digit localization (RTL support)
• Secure data handling for sensitive healthcare content

### How Does Awafi Clinic Work?:
Awafi is an electronic clinic that allows you to measure the severity of your psychological disorders and subscribe to the most suitable treatment program for your needs.

The treatment programs include educational material about the disorder and its treatment methods through written and video content. You will also engage in daily and weekly exercises to overcome the symptoms you are experiencing, all under full medical supervision.
